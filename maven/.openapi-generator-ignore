### Here we're explicitly ignoring all "supporting files" which are written by the client.

pom.xml
.openapi-generator/
# Ignoring files can be done using glob patterns just like in .gitignore
*.gradle
# .openapi-generator-ignore won't be overwritten if it already exists.
.openapi-generator-ignore
# Specifying existing directories such as "docs" means the generator won't output anything to that directory
docs/

# Existing files can be excluded. If they're a part of generated output, they won't be touched.
README.md

# You can also specify files you're unsure of.
petstore.yaml

### Another pattern you may follow is to ignore everything by default an explicitly include only those packages/files you're interested in.
### For example:
